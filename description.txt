NB! Changes in this code were made to 15.3.0 sdk example called ble_app_uart, since the project doesn't meet the end requirements, please copy main.c to that example and see my changes.

Sending coordinates to board should be done over serial connection (can use Putty for that). Set correct port, baud rate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bits: 1, parity: none, flow control: none.

UART data structure should be encoded and then pointer to encoded (ble_advdata_encode) data and previous advertising data should be provided to sd_ble_gap_adv_set_configure function, but unfortunately this pointer based solution was too difficult to understand for me.

Beacon name has set to CM_BLE and manufacturer specific data is changed to "AAAAA".
